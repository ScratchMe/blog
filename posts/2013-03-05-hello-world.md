Hey there, welcome on my new blog!

It's made of static files, generated with
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html) and largely based on [Cl√©ment
Delafargue's blog](http://blog.clement.delafargue.name) (Thank you :-) ).

You can check out the source on [my Github](https://github.com/urcadox/blog).
Don't hesitate to send a pull request if you find a typo somewhere.

I intend to write mainly about Scala (Play! related
stuff in particular), JavaScript, things I do with my Raspberry Pi and generally
anything which needs more than 140 characters to talk about, as well as tips /
reminders (might as well share them).

See you on my first real post!
